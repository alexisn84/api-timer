# Project: Web APIs: Code Quiz


## Description:
A fun holiday quiz to test Christmas knowledge in a multiple choice question format. Each question is presented with it's choices displayed in button click format. Once the user selects their answer a prompt appears to let them know if it was correct or incorrect, followed with the next question. At the end of the quiz, the user's final score will appear, along with an input field to enter their initials to be displayed in the high score list. Once they submit their initials they are taken to a new page that shows their score in the list according to ranking. They then have the option to "go back" to the starting page or to clear the high scores.
